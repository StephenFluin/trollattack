Todo List / Ideas:

Convert .are files to my xml format.
Make each area aware of all of its own rooms, mobiles, items, and players (for saving
	so we don't always have to scan all of the junk in the game)
Make int minposition work, instead of boolean mustBePeaceful
Fix Experience System
get rid of all instances of my LinkedList class so we can just import it instead of using java.util.LinkedList<Exit> all the time.
5. Pets and Mountable Mobiles
new spell system
6. Swimming and Water
Movement points
Guilds and Orders
Better Item Handling (in build system)
Speech

Known Bugs:
There has to be at least 2 items, mobiles, and rooms in the game.

Programming Things to fix:
handling of 1 / multiple items needs to be done seperately now... (fixed partially)
