He states: "Here, this may be needed on the journey ahead."  You can get the sword by typing "get sword".</description><east><vnum>3</vnum></east><west><vnum>1</vnum></west><item>1</item><item>1</item></room><room><vnum>3</vnum><title>Entering The World</title><description>Now that you have equipped yourself with some basic weapons and have familiarized yourself with some of the controls, you are ready to enter the world.
