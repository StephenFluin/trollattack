The remnant dust of magic lies in the corners of the room, indicating that perhaps this room is not only used for the storage of PeEll's items, but also as a testing room for the magical creation of new items.  The door to the east leads back into the rest of the house.  Neat shelves hold numerous standard items including numerous weapons, pieces of armor, and even items worth large amounts of gold.</description><title>Storage Room</title><east><vnum>1202</vnum><door>closed</door></east><item>1200</item><item>1201</item></room><room><vnum>1204</vnum><description>PeEll's kitchen does not have many of the modern conveniences, or the latest tools of the cooking trade, but it does have a large table to prepare meals on, and a huge stove against the north wall, allowing people to cook any of their favorite dishes.  The stove has a moveable stone floor, allowing you to cook using coal, wood, or any other material that generates heat.</description><title>The Kitchen</title><south><vnum>1202</vnum></south></room><room><vnum>1205</vnum><description>Change the title of this room by typing "rtitle &lt;new title&gt;".
