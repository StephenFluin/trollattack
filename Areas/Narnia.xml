The floor is made of a black marble that sparkles with specks of silver and veins of pale gold. Pillars reach far above the head and seem to melt right into the ceiling. Hidden alcoves are everywhere in the glimmering silver walls, statues of goddess-like figures standing tall. A melodically haunting music faintly fills the air. There appear to be three ways one may go: north south, or further east.</description><west><vnum>1000</vnum></west><item>1000</item></room><room><vnum>1000</vnum><title>Entrance to Benehlay Sancturary</title><description>A pathway overgrown by vines and foliage appears old and unused. A set steps leads up to large double doors that seem to have lost their luster. It seems that even the sky has faded in time, along with the glory that this building and garden must have once had.</description><east><vnum>1001</vnum></east><item>1001</item></room><room><vnum>1002</vnum><title>Entrance to Asherat's Aviary</title><description>Shafts of light fall upon mounds of sand. Marble walls shoot out of the sand and tower far above one's head. A scent of sulfur and raw meat hangs in the air. Many corridors lay ahead.</description></room><room><vnum>1004</vnum><title>A Freshly Created Room</title><description>Change the title of this room by typing "rtitle &lt;new title&gt;".
