In every room you have ever been in, there has been a list of exits below the description of the room (eg. &amp;WExits: East, West, North, Northeast.&amp;Y).  This shows you all of the directions that your character can see exits in.  Besides normal exits, you may also encounter doors, which may, or may not be able to be locked.  If you encounter a door that is closed, the exit name will be surrounded by brackets, "[west]", if you encounter a door that is open, the name will be surrounded by arrows "&lt;west&gt;".  If you want to pass a door that is currently closed, just type "&amp;Gopen direction&amp;Y".  On the other hand, if you want to close a door, type "&amp;Gclose direction&amp;Y".  There is a door to your west, feel free to try it out.</description><east><vnum>103</vnum></east><west><vnum>111</vnum><door>open</door></west></room><room><vnum>111</vnum><title>Exit Practice Room (Behind the door)</title><description>Change the title of this room by typing "redit title &lt;new title&gt;".
